Explanation:
JERBIL is an acronym. It stands for Java Entity Relational Based Interpretted Language  //maybe not...
How about this: JERBIL is a library for Java Relational Database SQL Generation. It is quite similar to JOOQ except it is tailor made for mysql, to take advantage
of mysql's best features. It also is adaptable to other SQL Databases like mssql, postgres etc... and also for nosql databases like couchbase, Cassandra, Mongodb etc...

High level architecture:
 -> needs to catch bugs when you compile it. Not later when it's running.
 -> User table, can be a variable or enumeration. 
 user = user.table()
 user.select();

Capability:
 -> Create a function that is able to fetch column names from the user table, and compare it to what you need to retrieve or insert, and auto-generate a alter table statement based on that.
